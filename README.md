Text to Image Generation using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)
Overview
This repository contains code for generating images from textual descriptions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The GAN architecture implemented here is specifically tailored for the task of synthesizing images from text descriptions.

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
TorchVision
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pillow
You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for training the GAN consists of pairs of textual descriptions and corresponding images. You can use any suitable dataset for this purpose, such as the CUB-200-2011 bird dataset or the COCO dataset.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess your dataset to create pairs of text-image samples. You may need to resize images and tokenize text descriptions.

Training: Train the GAN using the prepared dataset. Run the training script train.py and specify the appropriate hyperparameters. You may need to adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs based on your dataset and computational resources.

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 100 --batch_size 64
Inference: Once the model is trained, you can generate images from text descriptions using the generate.py script. Provide a text description as input, and the script will produce the corresponding image.

bash
Copy code
python generate.py --text "a red bird with a long tail"
Model Architecture
The GAN architecture used in this project consists of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator takes a text embedding as input and generates an image, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images. Both networks are trained simultaneously in a adversarial manner.

Results
After training the GAN on a suitable dataset, you can evaluate the quality of generated images by visually inspecting samples and by calculating quantitative metrics such as Inception Score or Frechet Inception Distance (FID).
